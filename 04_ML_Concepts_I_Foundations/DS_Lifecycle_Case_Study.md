# DS Lifecycle Phase 1 Case Study

## Problem Focus Questions

### Q1: What problems are facing the organization?
The organization is facing a variety of problems including response bias, a small dataset due to limited participation in the survey, and noisy data due to inconsistent interpretations of the survey questions.

### Q2: What is the target variable and what type (reg or class) of solution are they developing?
The target variable is to recommend an appropriate software to use across school districts. The solution would fall under classification because the software recommendations are discrete variables that can be assigned differently to individual schools within districts.

### Q3: How would they know the solution was working (business metric)?
Additional metrics of the solution's success include accuracy of recommendations, improved student performance, teacher satisfactions, and long-term cost savings.

### Q4: What other issues might the team be facing?
The team faces plenty of issues moving forward in the development of their solution including fitting into a budget, accounting for nuances of varying school districts, and mitigating biases in the training data.

## Data to Concept and Learning

### Q5: How difficult is the data to gather?
The survey is lengthy - 60 questions, and it is difficult to enforce participation in the survey. Respondents generally carry bias and can interpret questions differently.

### Q6: Is the target difficult to measure or break into smaller parts?
The target can be difficult to measure because it will require each school to implement a whole new software and learning experience for its students. After the solutions are put in place, it will take time until metrics can be collected about the target variableâ€™s outcomes. Breaking the target variable into smaller parts can allow the target to be measured in less time, but it can also diminish the outcomes seen compared to measuring the full solution. Examples of smaller parts that are worth measuring include: immediate financial costs to implement the solution or ease of putting the solution in place.

### Q7: What level of uncertainty (risk) are you willing to accept?
The biggest risks are suggesting a software solution that forces a poorer district to overspend on a new solution that may not be worth it. Influencing a school district to underspend on a solution can also present risks by not allocating resources effectively to improve student outcomes. These risks cannot be removed completely but can be minimized as much as possible through an effective model.
