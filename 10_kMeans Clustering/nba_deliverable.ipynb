    "In trying to tackle this problem, my goal was to build a data science model that displayed all current NBA players, revealing how well they performed in the 2023-2024 season based on various statistics. I then placed each NBA player in a 3D space, allowing me to see where players stand in comparison with each other based on statistics including points, minutes, and total rebounds. In addition to these statistics, I was able to apply a color for every player - this color serves as an indicator of that player's salary. In the visualization below, you can see that the yellow points represent players who earn very high salaries. Orange and pink data points indicate a salary that is middle tier. Data points that are dark purple represent players who are being paid on the low end of the spectrum in comparison to other NBA players.\n",
    "\n",
    "As one would expect, players with better statistics would have higher salaries and therefore be represented by a yellow/orange bullet point. But my goal here was to find the players with low salaries (purple and blue data points) that had statistics that were comparable to the top performing players. The visualization below allowed me to hand-pick out some of the highest-performing players in the league - although these players were being paid a relatively low salary last season. "
